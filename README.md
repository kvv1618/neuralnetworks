#### Notes
Total energy = Electricity + Natural Gas + Petroleum + Coal

## Methodology
Early phase:
- Pretrain the model on climate patterns
- Learn feature representations (e.g., seasonal trends, anomalies)
- Build the backbone of a model youâ€™ll later fine-tune with energy data

## Problem Setup
- Predict one climate variable (e.g., temperature_2m_mean) from others
- Learn seasonal/temporal dynamics
- Later: replace the target with energy consumption and fine-tune
