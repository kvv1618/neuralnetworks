#### Notes
- Total energy = Electricity + Natural Gas + Petroleum + Coal
- Estimated electric energy consumption = electric generation * (1 - loss_factor)
- Loss factor = 0.05
- _Assumption: Total Generation value for 1st of each month in the dataset corresponds to that month's totla generated energy_


## Methodology
Early phase:
- Pretrain the model on climate patterns
- Learn feature representations (e.g., seasonal trends, anomalies)
- Build the backbone of a model youâ€™ll later fine-tune with energy data

## Problem Setup
- Predict one climate variable (e.g., temperature_2m_mean) from others
- Learn seasonal/temporal dynamics
- Later: replace the target with energy consumption and fine-tune
